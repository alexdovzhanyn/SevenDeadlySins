# Seven Deadly Sins

## Introduction

> I'm going to go ahead and start off by saying this is a field in which I have absolutely no experience. Game development has always been something I've wanted to try, so I decided to take a stab at making a side-scrolling platformer game.

> This game features seven playable characters, for each of the seven deadly sins respectively. As of the time being, I'm not sure of the direction I want this game to take, the plot behind it, or any lore involved. A big part of the inspiration for this game was to create something that strayed from the perspective of, and brought a new meaning / resemblance to sin.

## Installation

> In order to get up and running with this, you'll need to either download the compiled binary for your OS once it becomes available, or build it from this repo. In the case that you need to build it, just clone this repository, and follow the setup instructions for the ruby2d framework as specified at http://www.ruby2d.com/.

> Once you've done that, just run `bundle install` and then `ruby game.rb`.
